"""
Acan - basic maths around brewing.

Overview
This Python module implements some equations used by homebrewers.  Although
there is no canonical formulas for procedures covered by Acan, I tried to
use those referenced by the most renowned sources.  Therefore, it is highly
probable that if you compare the results given by Acan with other softwares,
you'll find differences.  For the most cases, differences from the second or
third decimal place can be accepted, but bigger differences should be
examined with academical documents, like the NIST's [1].
